# IR-Remote
This project is to build an IR Remote for Sony Nex 5N Camera. 

AN Arduino Pro Mini is used as the Control Unit.
A PCB is designed to mount all the components together.
A plastic case is also designed and can be printed by 3d printers.

The arduino code use the multiCameraControl Libary by Sebastian Setz

Theoretically, all camera model include in multiCameraControl Libary (i.e. canon, nikon, olympus, minolta, sony, pentax,) should also be supported by this project by making slight modifications in the Arduino code. 
However, no test has been done except on the Sony Nex 5N Camera.
